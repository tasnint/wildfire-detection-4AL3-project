% You should write about your dataset here, following the guidelines regarding item 1. This section may be 0.5-1 pages. Depending on your specific dataset, you may want to include subsections for the preprocessing, annotation, etc.
\section{Dataset}
\input{3_Dataset.tex}

% Describe any features you used for your model, or how your data was input to your model. Are you doing feature engineering or feature selection? Are you learning embeddings? Is it all part of one neural network? Refer to item 2. This may range from 0.25 pages to 0.5 pages.
\section{Features}
\input{4_Features.tex}

% Describe your model and implementation here. Refer to item 4. This may take around a page.
\section{Implementation}

Our model is a feedforward classification model. It is composed of TODO Conv2D layers of size TODO with ReLu activation, followed by a Dense layer with TODO units. The model has TODO parameters in total, taking up about TODO MB in total.

Before training, we optimized various parameters empirically. We set out certain augmentations and resolutions to be tested, then trained a model on every dimension of this space via nested for loops that can be found in our code. This process is further outlined in the Features section. The size of layers and the number of layers were determined by manual empirical testing.

% How are you evaluating your model? What results do you have so far? What are your baselines? Refer to item 5. This may take around 0.5 pages.
\section{Results and Evaluation}
\input{6_Results_and_Evaluation.tex}

% Write about your plans for the remainder of the project. This should include a discussion of the feedback you received from your TA, and how you plan to improve your approach. Reflect on your implementation and areas for improvement. Refer to item 6. This may be around 0.5 pages.
