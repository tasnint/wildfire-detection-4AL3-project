\section{Introduction}

Here, write a brief introduction to the problem you are solving. This can be adapted from your problem description and motivation from the original proposal. This should be around 0.25-0.5 pages.

Wildfires are becoming increasingly prevalent and devastating due to climate change [https://science.nasa.gov/earth/explore/wildfires-and-climate-change/]. 
This poses a growing threat to both human safety and the environment, causing billions of dollars in damages each year and severely affecting air quality and biodiversity [https://www.canada.ca/en/services/health/healthy-living/environment/air-quality/wildfire-smoke/human-health-effects-report-summary.html], [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211464525002283], [https://www.nbcnews.com/science/climate-change/billion-dollar-disasters-economic-toll-wildfires-severe-storms-earthqu-rcna221473].  
Early detection of wildfires is crucial for effective response and mitigation efforts. However, detecting wildfires at an early stage can be challenging.
Subtle indicators such as light smoke or small flames can be obscured by dense vegetation, clouds, or varying terrain, often making traditional monitoring methods unreliable [https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/9/538], [https://www.mdpi.com/2571-6255/8/9/356].
In an attempt to address this issue, our project explores the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for automatic wildfire detection from images [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352484723010041], [https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/15/19/4855].
Our project formulates the task as a binary classification problem: given an RGB image of an area, the model identifies it as a “fire” or “no fire” scenario [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elmadafri/the-wildfire-dataset?resource=download].

\section{Related Work}

Here, talk about the related work you encountered for your approach. Cite at least 5 references. Refer to item 2. No one has done exactly your task? Write about the most similar thing you can find. This should be around 0.25-0.5 pages.

\section{Dataset}

You should write about your dataset here, following the guidelines regarding item 1. This section may be 0.5-1 pages. Depending on your specific dataset, you may want to include subsections for the preprocessing, annotation, etc.

\section{Features}

Describe any features you used for your model, or how your data was input to your model. Are you doing feature engineering or feature selection? Are you learning embeddings? Is it all part of one neural network? Refer to item 2. This may range from 0.25 pages to 0.5 pages.

Since convolutional neural networks (CNNs) learn features automatically, our “feature engineering” focuses on transformations that enhance spatial learning rather than on hand-crafted variables.

\section{Implementation}

Describe your model and implementation here. Refer to item 4. This may take around a page.

\section{Results and Evaluation}

How are you evaluating your model? What results do you have so far? What are your baselines? Refer to item 5. This may take around 0.5 pages.

\section{Feedback and Plans}

Write about your plans for the remainder of the project. This should include a discussion of the feedback you received from your TA, and how you plan to improve your approach. Reflect on your implementation and areas for improvement. Refer to item 6. This may be around 0.5 pages.

\section{Template Notes}

You can remove this section or comment it out, as it only contains instructions for how to use this template. You may use subsections in your document as you find appropriate.

\subsection{Tables and figures}

See Table~\ref{citation-guide} for an example of a table and its caption.
See Figure~\ref{fig:experiments} for an example of a figure and its caption.

    Example image is usually available through the \texttt{mwe} package
    without even mentioning it in the preamble.}

  \begin{tabular}{lll}

    \textbf{Output}           & \textbf{natbib command} & \textbf{ACL only command} \\

\end{table*}

Table~\ref{citation-guide} shows the syntax supported by the style files.
We encourage you to use the natbib styles.
You can use the command \verb|\citet| (cite in text) to get ``author (year)'' citations, like this citation to a paper by \citet{Gusfield:97}.
You can use the command \verb|\citep| (cite in parentheses) to get ``(author, year)'' citations \citep{Gusfield:97}.
You can use the command \verb|\citealp| (alternative cite without parentheses) to get ``author, year'' citations, which is useful for using citations within parentheses (e.g. \citealp{Gusfield:97}).

\subsection{References}

\nocite{Ando2005,andrew2007scalable,rasooli-tetrault-2015}

Many websites where you can find academic papers also allow you to export a bib file for citation or bib formatted entry. Copy this into the \texttt{custom.bib} and you will be able to cite the paper in the \LaTeX{}. You can remove the example entries.

\subsection{Equations}

An example equation is shown below:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:example}
  A = \pi r^2
\end{equation}

Labels for equation numbers, sections, subsections, figures and tables
are all defined with the \verb|\label{label}| command and cross references
to them are made with the \verb|\ref{label}| command.
This an example cross-reference to Equation~\ref{eq:example}. You can also write equations inline, like this: $A=\pi r^2$.
