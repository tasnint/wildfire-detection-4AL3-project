Our model is a feedforward classification model. It is composed of TODO Conv2D layers of size TODO with ReLu activation, followed by a Dense layer with TODO units. The model has TODO parameters in total, taking up about TODO MB in total.
Before training, we optimized various parameters empirically. We set out certain augmentations and resolutions to be tested, then trained a model on every dimension of this space via nested for loops that can be found in our code. This process is further outlined in the Features section. The size of layers and the number of layers were determined by manual empirical testing.
