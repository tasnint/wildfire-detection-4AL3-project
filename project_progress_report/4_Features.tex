The feature set for our model comprises of the pixel values from the images themselves. 
The images are mainly RGB type images meaning they compose of three colour channels red, green, and blue. 
The resolution also dictates the number of pixels within a given image. 
For example, a 128x128 resolution image means there are 128 * 128 * 3 = 49152 feature values that corresponde to
the RGB colour values. The higher the resolution more features there are and vice versa. 
During preprocesssing, the images are compressed to a fixed resolution (128x128, 224x224, etc...),
 so that the input array remains the same. The pixel values are placed in 3D-dimensional matrix.
This form of feature engineering alows for spacial recognition and patten extraction on a 3D space.
