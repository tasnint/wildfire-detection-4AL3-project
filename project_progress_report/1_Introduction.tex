Wildfires are becoming increasingly prevalent and devastating due to climate change \cite{ref1_WildfiresClimateChange2025}. 
This poses a growing threat to both human safety and the environment, causing billions of dollars in damages each year and severely affecting air quality and biodiversity \cite{ref2_WildfireSmoke2024}, [], [].  
Early detection of wildfires is crucial for effective response and mitigation efforts. However, detecting wildfires at an early stage can be challenging.
Subtle indicators such as light smoke or small flames can be obscured by dense vegetation, clouds, or varying terrain, often making traditional monitoring methods unreliable [], [].
In an attempt to address this issue, our project explores the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for automatic wildfire detection from images [], [].
Our project formulates the task as a binary classification problem: given an RGB image of an area, the model identifies it as a “fire” or “no fire” scenario [].
