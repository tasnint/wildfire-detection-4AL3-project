Tanisha contributed by writing the Introduction and Features (1 \& 3)  sections of the report.
She implemented the preprocessing and augmentation code and the baseline model.
She also helped migrate our model training onto the Google Cloud platform.
She trained several of the models and also finalized the most optimal combination of pixel size and augmentations used in the experiments.

Andy researched different models and implementations. Worked on the code based for said models (effnet,resnet, and mobilenet). Contributed by writing sections 5, 6, and 7.

Berk wrote the dataset and implementation sections. They also ran experiments with different models and augmentations. They helped research earlier in the project to find a usable dataset and methods to train a model on it.
