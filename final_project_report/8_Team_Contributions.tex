Tanisha contributed by writing the Introduction and Features (1 \& 3)  sections of the report.
She implemented the preprocessing and augmentation code and the baseline model.
She also helped migrate our model training onto the Google Cloud platform.
She trained several of the models and also finalized the most optimal combination of pixel size and augmentations used in the experiments.

Andy research different models and implementations. Worked on the code based for said models (effnet,resnet, and mobilenet). Contributed by writing sections 5, 6, and 7.
